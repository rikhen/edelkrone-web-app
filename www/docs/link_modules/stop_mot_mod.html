<h3 id="how-to-control-your-device-with-stop-motion-module">How To Control Your Device With Stop Motion Module</h3>
<p>The edelkrone SDK will notify you of each module plugged into the PC.</p>
<p><img alt="link_id_ss" src="../res/link_id_stop.png" /></p>
<p>This notification appears in the notification area of your OS. This notification contains the Link ID of your link module. This ID is also required to distinguish if you have multiple modules when sending commands. </p>
<p>You will then again receive a notification that the SDK has recognized your module and open communication channel.</p>
<p><img alt="open_connection" src="../res/connection_open.png" /></p>
<h4 id="how-to-get-the-link-id-of-stop-motion-module-and-its-status">How to get the Link ID of Stop Motion Module and its status</h4>
<p>To control your device, you first need to get the Link ID of the Stop Motion Module. You can get the Link ID of the Stop Motion Module. </p>
<p><a href="../endpoints/commands/device/device.html#get-link-module-list-and-status">Get Link Module List and Status Command</a></p>
<p>Also, this command you can use to get the status of other link modules.</p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p>Almost all commands need that ID. Also, the Link ID must be saved for later usage.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="how-to-manage-multiple-devices">How to manage multiple devices</h4>
<p>Stop Motion Module is automatically paired with the connected device via a patch cable. Paired device(s) after completing pairing are called a <a href="../definitions.html#bundle">bundle</a>. </p>
<p>But, you may want to control multiple devices; you need to pair them with the device connected with the Stop Motion Module. But Stop Motion Module does not have any pairing ability, and the edelkrone SDK does not have any pair command for the Stop Motion Module; you can use the edelkrone mobile application to pair them.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-get-the-status-of-edelkrone-devices-in-bundle">How to get the status of edelkrone devices in bundle</h4>
<p>The bundle status is automatically updated from edelkrone devices when the pairing process is completed.</p>
<p>The status contains paired devices information, supported axis, supported real-time axis, bundle status, axis values of the devices.</p>
<p>You can get status by using this command <a href="../endpoints/endpoints_http.html#status">status end point</a>.</p>
<h4 id="send-move-command-to-your-bundle">Send move command to your bundle</h4>
<p>There are four types of movement. Except for real-time moves, other movement types can be controlled over HTTP API. But, HTTP has several overheads; therefore, you need to prefer Websocket Protocol to manage in real-time.</p>
<h5 id="1-joystick">1. Joystick</h5>
<p>This command takes the speed ratio in the axis to be moved from you and makes it move at that speed in that direction.</p>
<p>This movement supports a five-axis that depends on your bundle.</p>
<p>For example;
Your bundle has three axes, for example, pan, tilt, and slide. And you want to send a move command in these three axes.</p>
<p>Just add the axes you want and their speed ratio.</p>
<p>You can also find more details about that api command <a href="../endpoints/commands/move/move.html#joystick-move">here</a> .</p>
<h5 id="2-keypose">2. Keypose</h5>
<p>You can save up to six poses. You can make a loop between these poses, or you can send your bundle from a point you want to a pose you want.</p>
<h6 id="1-keypose-store-current-pose">1. Keypose Store Current Pose</h6>
<p>When you send this command, a pose with an index number of your bundle at the time will be stored for you.  </p>
<p>You can also find more details about that api command <a href="../endpoints/commands/keypose/keypose.html#keypose-store-current-pose">here</a> .</p>
<h6 id="2-keypose-store-by-numeric-data">2. Keypose Store By Numeric Data</h6>
<p>Numeric data means your axis values, which are you want to save as pose.  </p>
<p>You can also find more details about that api command <a href="../endpoints/commands/keypose/keypose.html#keypose-store-by-numeric-data">here</a> .</p>
<h6 id="3-keypose-move-with-fixed-duration">3. Keypose Move with Fixed Duration</h6>
<p>You can make your bundle go from any point to a pose you want with this command. But this movement takes place with the fixed duration you give. But movement speed varies according to the given time.</p>
<p>You can also find from more details about that api command <a href="../endpoints/commands/keypose/keypose.html#keypose-move-with-fixed-duration">here</a> .</p>
<h6 id="4-keypose-move-with-fixed-speed">4. Keypose Move with Fixed Speed</h6>
<p>You can make your bundle go from any point to a pose you want with this command. But this movement takes place with the fixed speed ratio you give. But the duration of the movement varies according to the given speed ratio.</p>
<p>You can also find more details about that api command <a href="../endpoints/commands/keypose/keypose.html#keypose-move-with-fixed-speed">here</a> .</p>
<h6 id="5-loop-between-keyposes-with-fixed-duration">5.  Loop Between Keyposes with Fixed Duration</h6>
<p>With this command, you can create loops between the poses you recorded. This movement takes place with the fixed duration you give.
But movement speed varies according to the given time.</p>
<p>You can also find more details about that api command <a href="../endpoints/commands/keypose/keypose.html#loop-between-keyposes-with-fixed-duration">here</a> .</p>
<h6 id="5-loop-between-keyposes-with-fixed-speed">5.  Loop Between Keyposes with Fixed Speed</h6>
<p>With this command, you can create loops between the poses you recorded. This movement takes place with the fixed speed you give. But movement duration varies according to the given speed ratio.</p>
<p>You can also find more details about that api command <a href="../endpoints/commands/keypose/keypose.html#loop-between-keyposes-with-fixed-speed">here</a> .</p>
<h6 id="6-read-keypose-numeric-information">6. Read Keypose Numeric Information</h6>
<p>With this command, you can read the axis values of the pose you stored. It takes an index as an argument and returns information that you want to get.</p>
<p>You can also find more details about that api command <a href="../endpoints/commands/keypose/keypose.html#read-keypose-numeric-information">here</a>.</p>
<h6 id="7-delete-keypose">7. Delete Keypose</h6>
<p>When you store a keypose, it occupies a slot in a keypose list. If you need to add a new keypose, you need to delete keypose.</p>
<p>You can also find from more details about that api command <a href="../endpoints/commands/keypose/keypose.html#delete-keypose">here</a> .</p>
<h5 id="3-focus-move">3. Focus Move</h5>
<p>You can use it for focus movement when you plugged a focus module into your head.</p>
<p>You can also find from more details about that api command <a href="../endpoints/commands/move/move.html#focus-manual-move">here</a> .</p>
<h5 id="4-real-time-move">4. Real-Time Move</h5>
<p>The Stop Motion Module supports <a href="../definitions.html#real-time-move">Real-Time</a>.</p>
<p>Real-Time movement needs a reliable communication channel. So wireless connection does not support real-time movement.</p>
<p>You can also find more details about that api command <a href="../endpoints/endpoints_ws.html">here</a> .   </p>
